# LIBRARY-RESOURCES-AND-SERVICES-UTILIZATION-IN-JKUAT
## A Study carried out in JKUAT to investigate factors influencing utilization of the library
My name is Frankline Mwenda. This was an undergraduate project that I was involved with before finishing my degree program.
I was concerned by the number of students who were accessing the campus library during my four years there. 
I knew there had to be expalnations to this and tried to write down the factors that could contribute to either utilizing the resources or not.
The factors that I could come up with included the Faculty of the students, Level of study, the place of residence of student among others.
I went ahead to build a logistic regression model using the factors as the explanatory variables to predict level of utilization of a student.
I build other machine learning models to try get a more accurate prediction as shown in my notebook.
Though I did not get an efficient model I believe this project can help beginners understand the concepts of machine learning and how to make predictions.
